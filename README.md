# Heuristic-Evaluation_GroupProject
## Goals
In this project, we perform heuristic evaluation of https://www.hec.gov.pk. This is the website of 
higher education commission. Our main goal during this heuristic evaluation was to 
check/evaluate the usability of this website with some set of heuristics techniques and provide a 
set of issues related to this website for the website developers. So we believe that our findings 
will make the interface better in future when the developers want to update it.
## Method
During this evaluation, we use “Andrews General Usability Heuristics”. The findings are recorded 
by each team member independently by performing the tests several times and after this; we 
rate each issue in range of 1-5 depending upon their severity.
## Findings
In this usability test, we identified more than 65 issues. They are described in details in attached Report:
