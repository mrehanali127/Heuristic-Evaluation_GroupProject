Problems 

-------- 

  

o Short Title: Login/Sign in option 

  Description: 

Login or sign in button is usually placed at top the webpages, as it is considered as a standard place to fit login button/option. But in this website login button is at the bottom right corner, which is confusing for user, as almost all the websites place the login button at the top right corner.
