Positive Impressions
--------------------

Title : Accesscibility of content

Description
	The navigation bar contains the link of all pages, so from the navbar you can access all the content avilible on the website. 
	This is very helpful for new users because they didn't have complete knowledge about the website and if we donot show what our
	website contains, he will not be able to explore it in better way. So the navbar provide easiness for novice users.

Title : Separation of content

Description 
	The content of website is divided into 3 categories (Students, Teachers, Representitive). This is helpful for novice users as well
	as for expert users, because a student will not mess up with the content related to teachers and vice versa. This categoration reduce
	the time for searching a specific content related to one category.

Title : Language duality support

Description
	The website supports language duality, user can switch website language between urdu and english. This is helpfull in a scenario like, an
	urdu mediuem student looking for some information, so changing the language to urdu will be helpfull for him/her. Also if some people
	which are not familiar with english can use it.

Title : Color scheme

Description
	The color of this wensite is simple which make it very attractive. Normally users prefer simple colors scheme in websites related to
	studies because they are concerned with the content not with the colors that much.

Title : Free from annoying adds

Description
	This website is free from annoying and unnessesary adds which tend the user to spend more time on website as compared to the website
	which contains adds. In common practise, a user after facing unnecessary adds 3 to 4 time leave the website and search it required
	information on some other websites or use some other sources.








Problems
------------------------------

Title : Sign in option

  Description
	The sign in option is located at the bottom right corner and is nearly hidden, because in common practise this button/option is avilible 
	at the top right place ( inside the navbar ) so when a user visit the website, he can see it easily. But in HEC website this button is
	at the end, this is very difficult for novice users to find it.

  Heuristic:  Recognition Rather Than Recall

  Location - Home-->sign in

Title : Aimbiguity in error messages
   Description
	During the sign in operation, when the user enters incorrect username or password, it doesn't show any error, instead it just reload the TAB
	and again demands for username and password. This will create problem for users during loggining in and he/she will not be able to know if
	the username is wrong or the pasword is wrong. 

  Heuristic:  Good error message

  Location - Home--->sign in--->Enter

Title : Retundancy in tabs/links
   Description
	The tabs/links in navigation bar are exaactly repeated in the footer section. 	
  Location - Home page
  Heuristic:  Aesthetic and Minimalist Design


Title : Bad design
    Description
	In the sholarship page, the useful link must be about some scholarships but these are links to the main page.
  Location : Home --> Scholarships
  Heuristic : Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
