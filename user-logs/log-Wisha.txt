Positive Impressions

--------------------

o News and Media:
    
There is a separate option for news and media in the header. It would be easy for the user to go through the latest updates.

o Separate Categories:
   
There are separate categories for students, faculty members, and university. This option makes it user friendly. A particular user can get help through the site easily.

Problems

-------------------


o Homepage Banners Design

Description
   
The banners on the homepage have a lot of text on them. There must be some graphics that could make it user-friendly. 

Heuristic: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Location - How reproducible?: Homepage ---> Banner

o Homepage Banners Permalinks

Description
   
The icons on banners must be clickable and allow a user to redirect to that particular website. But these are not working in this way. When we click on any icon on a banner, it redirects to the hec website itself.

Heuristic: Consistency

Location - How reproducible?:Homepage ---> Banner ---> Icons

o Homepage Banners Content

Description
   The banners must have the latest scholarship ads but these are also not up-to-date. 

Heuristic: Help and Documentation

Location - How reproducible?: Homepage ---> Banner

o Upcoming Events

Description
   
There must be a slider in the upcoming events portion rather than the 'see all' button. It could allow the user to do just one click and move to another event. In the case of the 'see all' button, it takes a lot of load time to move to another page.

Heuristic: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Location - How reproducible? Homepage ---> Upcoming Events ---> see all button

o Blog

Description
  It should be removed from the homepage because they don't have any content for the blog. They are showing coming soon in the blog and it looks strange. 

Heuristic: Feedback

o Contact Us Location

Description
  
Contact Us option must be in the header menu of the website but on this website, this page's link is in the footer. 

Heuristic: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Location - How reproducible? Homepage ---> Footer ---> Contact Us

o Contact Us Page UI
Description

There must be a contact form along with contact information. And the contact us page must have only contact information like contact number, email, social media pages links, etc. But on the contact page of this website, there is a lot more information. So, the user can get confused about it.

o Join Hec

Description
  This page is not loading. There is some error on this page and it does not show any message.

Heuristic: Good Error Messages

Location - How reproducible? Homepage ---> About ---> Join HEC

o Commission members images

Description
  
There is a picture of only one commission member. They should either add images of all members or remove the image option for all members. The dummy image in place of member's images is not looking good.

Heuristic: Feedback
